# Fluorine Manager

Fluorine Manager an attempt at porting [MO2 (Mod Organizer 2)](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer) to linux with FUSE as the VFS system.

NOTE: This is primarily for my personal use but I will see about fixing issues if I can. I use Claude/Codex, if you don't like AI please don't use this application. I'm looking for feedback not hate.

## Current Status

- Core app builds and runs on Linux.
- NaK integration is wired for game/proton detection and dependency handling.
- Linux-native game plugins (`libgame_*.so`) are supported.
- Portable instances are supported via local `ModOrganizer.ini` detection.

## FUSE Permissions

- Users only need to change `/etc/fuse.conf` when MO2 mounts with `allow_other` (or `allow_root`).
- If `allow_other` is used, uncomment `user_allow_other` in `/etc/fuse.conf` once (system-wide).

## Example

`#user_allow_other` to `user_allow_other` if its missing please add it.

## Installing and Running
Download the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/Fluorine-Manager/releases) and after you download it.

You are able to run it with this command: `./fluorine-manager` or by double-clicking it.

More information can be found in the [FAQ](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/Fluorine-Manager/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md).

You can find me in the [NaK Discord](https://discord.gg/9JWQzSeUWt)

If you want to support the things I put out, I do have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sulfurnitride) I will never charge money for any of my content.

## Building



## Known Limitations

- Some third-party MO2 plugins are Windows-only and will fail on Linux (for example DLL/ctypes `windll` assumptions).
- Themes are currently not working as intended.
